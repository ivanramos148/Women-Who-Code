## Ivan Ramos Meet UP Experience
### "Javascript Study Night"
* Hosted by: Women Who Code

Me and My sister saw on MeetUp.com that there was a "Javascript Study Night" by Women Who Code.
We both decided it would be a great meet up since in one weeks our course will on Javascript
and it would be a great refresher for us.

There was about 15 people attending to the meet up, they told us about their code of conduct first of all,
how everyone was treated equally. After everyone gave a quick introduction to each other

* Their name
* What was their favorite function
* What was their favorite drink

The host then started to explain to us about the console and what developers did on there, we learn a cool thing about the console. We learned that it's possible to completely manipulate and style within the console

* Examples:
  * Console.error():
    * Outputs an error message. You may use string substitution and additional arguments with this method.
  * Console.group():
    * Creates a new inline group, indenting all following output by another level. To move back out a level, call groupEnd().
  * Console.info():
    * Informative logging of information. You may use string substitution and additional arguments with this method.

One more thing they taught us was about what API's were, though im still not clear about what it still is.. it's great they gave us information about it and gave us good secrets about he console that we didn't know about.

After that people had an oppurinity to share their projects on Javascript or they had a chance to work on Javascript on their personal devices, we saw some pretty cool things people could do and the stuff they presented
