## Ivan Ramos Meet UP
### "Javascript Study Night"
* Hosted by: Women Who Code

Me and My sister saw on MeetUp.com that there was a "JavaScript Study Night" by Women Who Code on February 27th.
We both decided it would be a great meet up since in one week our course in Epicodus will be on JavaScript,
we both agreed it would be a great refresher for us. There was about 15 people attending to the meet up, they told us about their code of conduct first of all,
how everyone was treated equally, then everyone gave a quick introduction to get to know each other

### Things they asked:
* Their name
* What was their favorite function in JavaScript
* What was their favorite drink

The host then started to explain to us about the console and what developers used it for, we learn a cool thing about the console. We learned that it's possible to completely manipulate and style within the console using CSS, down below are one of the cool styles the host showed us.

* Examples:
  * Console.error():
    * Outputs an error message. You may use string substitution and additional arguments with this method.
  * Console.group():
    * Creates a new inline group, indenting all following output by another level. To move back out a level, call groupEnd().
  * Console.info():
    * Informative logging of information. You may use string substitution and additional arguments with this method.

Another thing they taught us was about what API's were, though I'm still not clear about what it is.. it's great they gave us information about it and gave us good secrets about the console that we didn't know about, after that people had an opportunity to share their projects on JavaScript or they had a chance to work on JavaScript on their personal devices, we saw some pretty cool things people could do and the stuff they presented, wish i could've shown something but i had no clue we could bring our personal devices to share our projects.

### Would I Recommend this event?

Personally i recommend this event to anyone who's interested in learning more about JavaScript or overall coding in general, the people who attended to the JavaScript meet-up were very friendly with one another and respect each other.
